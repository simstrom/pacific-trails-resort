          <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
          <p>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each
            yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
          </p>

          <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
          <p>
            Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired
            stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink
            with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
            located in the lodge.
          </p>

          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>
            Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack
            comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with
            layers of clothing.
